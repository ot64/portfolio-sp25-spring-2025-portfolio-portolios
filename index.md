## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a minor in computer science. I'm passionate about designing thoughtful, functional systems that solve real world problems.

Most recently, in my Introduction to Mechanical Design course (MAE 2250), I worked with a team to design a dropdown shelf aimed at helping college students and others in small living spaces access high storage. The shelf promotws vertical storage in a practical, space-saving way and was designed with both accessibility and manufacturability in mind. Projects liek this fuel my itnerest in creating mechanical systems that respond to everyday needs.

Outside the classroom, I'm a member of Cornell Mars Rover (CMR) engineering project team, where we build a multidisciplinary rover platform for simulated planetary exploration. I am on the AstroTech mechanical subteam wehere I contribute to mechanical and software-integrated systems that support tasks like scientific analysis and remote operation. In research, I am helping optimize a wearable pneumatic turbine sysem for energy harveting from human motion, focusing on casing fabrication, turbine-blade design, and textile integration for real-world durability.

Beyond physical design, I have been exploring app development, designing and building mobile tools to solve problems I care about. I enjoy blending engineering and creativity, and I am always excited to learn, iterate, and bring ideas to life.
